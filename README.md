# ðŸ¤– Tricky AI Chatbot

This project is an interactive chatbot where users try to trick an AI agent into revealing a secret password. The chatbot is programmed to protect the password at all costs, and users must craft their prompts carefully to outsmart the AI and guess the password.

## ðŸš€ Features

- **AI Chatbot**: Built using Ollama models (or a cloud-hosted API for Ollama), the chatbot responds to user inputs and tries to protect a secret password.
- **Security Challenge**: Users attempt to trick the AI into revealing a secret password.
- **Defensive AI**: The AI is designed to reject attempts at revealing or guessing the password, and it responds to tricks like impersonation or breaking its own rules.
